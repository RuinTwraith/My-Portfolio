    <h1 class="heading">Organising workflow</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Here is a general idea of what the organization process should look like from start to finish:
    </p>
        <h3 class="heading">Step 1: Name your workflow.</h3 class="heading">  <p class="para"> name should help you identify your ultimate outcome, but don’t worry too much about this, as you can change it later.</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading">Step 2: Identify start and end points.</h3> <p class="para"> What events or tasks will trigger the process to start? How will you know when your outcome has been reached?</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading">Step 3: Identify what is needed to perform the process.</h3> <p class="para"> What tasks, documents, and actual materials (paper, pens, automation software, programs, etc.) are needed to complete the process?</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading">Step 4: List any tasks and activities.</h3> <p class="para"> What needs to be done to accomplish your outcome? State these in a verb/object format (e.g. approve the request, sign the paperwork, etc.). Each task may get its own box in your flowchart or diagram, so you can group minor tasks together if necessary.</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading">Step 5: Identify the order tasks should be accomplished.</h3><p class="para">  Should certain tasks be finished before others can be started? Or can certain tasks be accomplished at the same time?</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading">Step 6: Identify roles.</h3> <p class="para"> Who will be involved in what tasks or activities? Some tasks may involve simple automation tools and no human approval, while others will need a review and sign off. Identify who is responsible for which task and process in your workflow. Add a swim lane for each role in your swimlane diagram.</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading">Step 7: Identify your flowchart type and draw it out.</h3> <p class="para"> Again, swimlane diagrams are best for processes, while a simple flowchart may work for projects or other smaller workflows. You can either draw one out by hand or use a tool like Visio, gliffy.com or draw.io.</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading">Step 8: Review and finalize.</h3> <p class="para"> After you’ve set everything up, you will want to test your workflow and review it to ensure that all processes are efficient and achievable and that everything accomplishes what it needs to accomplish.</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading">Step 9: Use a workflow automation tool to create your actual workflow.</h3> <p class="para"> Once your workflow is finalized, you can use workflow automation software to set up your actual workflow and integrate it with other software. Don’t forget to test your systems to make sure there are no hiccups throughout the process.</p>
